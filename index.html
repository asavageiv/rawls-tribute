        John Rawls is the fucking man. He's the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. Maybe the greatest of all
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you like having rights? freedom? democracy? Are you happy you don't live in a shitty
        authoritarian communist regime or an equally shitty lassaiz-faire capitalist hellscape? Or maybe you do live in
        one of those and wish you had the tools to fight them. Are you tired of listening to shitty, poorly thought out,
        incoherent opinions based in myopic pictures of reality? Well thank John Rawls because he's laid down some
        <i>fat, juicy</i> pieces of logic, just for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        John Rawls's <i>bad ass</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice">Theory of Justice</a>,
        gives us principles for the basic structure of society that are actually <i>fair</i>. How does he do that? With
        some beautiful thought experiment tools called the "veil of ignorance" and the "original position".
      </p>
      <p>
        What the hell does that mean? Think about it this way: If we're going to cut up a cake fairly, we shouldn't let
        the guy doing the cutting decide who gets what pieces, right? Hell no! So when we're deciding the principles of
        justice, we shouldn't let people argue using their own position either. Rich people will say lower taxes on the
        rich are better, poor people will say they should get more money for doing less work, blah blah blah. We need a
        way to get rid of those biases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well Rawls figured that out. It's easy! When you're arguing about principles of justice, just imagine what a
        group of people would say if they didn't know anything specific about society or their place in society. They
        know general stuff about humanity, like "people all need to eat" and "everybody has their own idea of what's
        good they want to follow". But they don't know their race, religion, wealth, etc., or the general distribution
        of those things in society. By taking away all those facts from these fuckers, we keep them from cutting too
        big a slice of the cake of justice for themselves. Get it?
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the "original position" because these people are at the origin before anything else has been decided. The
        "veil of ignorance" is their lack of knowledge. They don't have a constitution yet to appeal to. If they
        want one, they're going to have to justify it to everyone in the group. Everyone in the group is still trying to
        make out the best they can for themselves. They're still self-interested assholes, just like in real life, but
        that's too our benefit now, because they can only argue for things that will end up being good for all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alright, I'm with you. I get the veil, I get the OP. Well how the fuck do I get from that to rights, freedom,
        equality, and democracy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, think about it. Someone behind the OP knows that when they enter society, they're going to have some ideas
        about how they want to live their life. They're going to want the freedom to explore whatever dumb ideas they
        come up with, and they're going to want rights that guarantee those freedoms. The only way they're gonna be able
        to argue for those rights
        is if they agree that everyone can have them. None of this "black people are 3/5 of a person" bull shit. None of
        this "women can't vote" bull shit. That's our first principle:
        <ol>
          <li>Everybody gets rights that guarantee their liberty and everybody gets the same rights</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, ok, I get how we get rights and how that guarantees freedom. What about equality though? What if I'm born
        stupid or poor? I don't want to be made a slave or have a shitty life because of it. And I don't want to have to
        work a lot harder than anybody else if I'm not going to get more for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, now you're getting it. Nobody wants to be fucked because of bad luck. But we also know that there's got to
        be an incentive to work hard. If some lady is great at making more fantastic cake, but it might only be worth it
        to her if she gets a dope car I don't get, then allowing some inequality might still be in my best interest. I
        want that cake. So, we don't know if we'll be born rich or poor, we want incentive to work hard, and we want it
        to work out for us both ways. How about this? Some people can be better off, but only if everyone had fair
        opportunity for that spot (not everyone wants to be president). And they can only be better off if it makes the
        least well off better too. None of the bullshit, "my mega yacht is worth 1 billion dollars and those people
        would only ever make a few million worth of product in their entire lives, so we're clearly better off with my
        yacht" utilitarian garbage. No one wants to be a wage slave just so rich people can be even richer. There's
        our second principle, so we've got:
        <ol>
          <li>Everybody gets rights that guarantee their liberty and everybody gets the same rights</li>
          <li>Socioeconomic inequality is fine as long as there's fair equality of opportunity and it's to the greatest
            benefit of the least-advantaged in society.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait a minute, wait a minute. What do you mean by "fair equality of opportunity"? Trying to slip one by me
        mother-fucker? Just because a constitution says technically anyone over 35 can apply for the job of president
        doesn't mean everyone has the opportunity. In reality it takes a shit load of money to win those seats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, yeah. You're right. Fair equality of opportunity means that people will the same ability and willingness
        to work should have about the same chances in life. A poor kid who's smart and willing to work hard should have
        about as good of a chance as a rich kid at being president, ceo, senator, or whatever other important positions
        are out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alright, there we have it. The basics of Rawls's bad ass "justice as fairness" giving us rules for rights and
        equality. Think about this shit next time you vote. Do we have fair equality of opportunity? Can we make it
        better? And be grateful that you have the rights to choose. Thank Rawls for showing us how it all aligns with
        reason.
