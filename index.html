      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This is a tribute to John Rawls, my favorite political philosopher. His conception of political justice as
        "fairness" and the tools of the Original Position and the Veil of Ignorance greatly influenced me. They gave me
        a structured way to think about how to design a fair society which helped me reason my way through the thicket
        of political ideas out there. It gave me an idea of how our most fundamental institutions must change to be more
        just and the ways in which they are good at securing a measure of justice today. I like the way his ideas result
        in a society where people have the best chance of being free to pursue a worthy goal of their own choosing.
        There is a good balance of individual liberty and responsibility as a member of society. Even if you don't agree
        with his conclusions, his ideas are useful to understand as a way of thinking. I have tried to present his
        principles of justice and an outline of their reasoning as briefly and simply as possible so even
        non-philosophers can appreciate them. In doing so, I have undoubtedly oversimplified, but despite that I hope
        you find them interesting and enlightening.

      <h3>The Principles of Justice as Fairness</h3>

      <p>
        If you learn nothing else from Rawls, learn this. The <i>principles of justice</i> that would be chosen for a
        society that is <i>a fair system of cooperation between free and equal citizens from one generation to the
          next</i> are:
        <ol id="principles">
          <li>
            Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of
            equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all.
          </li>
          <li>
            Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions:
            <ol id="sub-principles">
              <li>
                They are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of
                opportunity.
              </li>
              <li>
                They are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference
                principle).
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are prioritized such that the first principle must be satisfied before the second, and fair equality of
        opportunity must be satisfied before the difference principle. Furthermore, these principles only apply to the
        basic institutions of society. For example, the can compare property-owning democracy and democratic socialism
        to show they are compatible with these principles of justice, while laissez-faire capitalism, welfare-state
        capitalism, and socialist command economies are not. However, they should not be used to compare a beggar and a
        working mother and say that the beggar deserves some of the mother's money because they're worse off. The way
        the principles are derived limits them to the broad, general rules of a society. This is what makes it a
        political conception of justice, rather than a metaphysical one that would apply in all cases in the same way.
      </p>

      <h3>Society as a Fair System of Cooperation</h3>
      <div class="quotebox">
        <div class="quote">"The correct regulative principle for anything depends on the nature of that thing."</div>
        <div class="citation"><i>A Theory of Justice</i></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Rawls attacks the problem of justice and society at its roots by starting with its <i>basic structure</i>. By
        basic structure we mean things like the laws of the constitution and the economic system. All activity within
        society takes place withing the context of these structures, so we have no hope for a just society if the
        structures themselves are unjust. So, Rawls wants to come up with reasonable principles we can use to determine
        whether a basic structure is just or not; the principles of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        To come up with reasonable principles, we have to be clear about what we're talking about. What do we mean by
        "society"? Rawls defines society as, "a fair system of cooperation among its members from one generation to the
        next". This definition is why Rawls's conception of justice is called "justice as fairness". It has its roots in
        the idea of the social contract; that the legitimacy of government derives from the consent of the
        governed<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, and the fact of reasonable plurality in society (reasonable
        people in society can disagree). There are other conceptions of society. For example, monarchies were often
        thought to derive their legitimacy from divine right. Rawls's definition is broader and more vague so it might
        bring more of us on board. Fairness, equality before the law, and freedom are highly regarded ideals in
        democratic societies, so starting there gives us a broad base of acceptability.
      </p>
      <h3>Fair Conditions: The Original Position and the Veil of Ignorance</h3>
      <div class="quotebox">
        <div class="quote">"In justice as fairness, men agree to share one another's fate."</div>
        <div class="citation"><i>A Theory of Justice</i></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        What do we mean by "fair"? In the most general case this could have a lot of answers, but in the context of
        political justice we can change the question to, “What terms of cooperation would free and equal citizens agree
        to under fair conditions?”. This makes the problem more tractable by allowing us to define fair conditions and
        then considering what would be agreed to under those conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have fair conditions, personal biases and historical biases must be removed, so Rawls asks us to imagine
        ourselves in an <i>original position</i> behind a <i>veil of ignorance</i>. In the original position a group of
        representatives must unanimously decide on the principles of justice for society. The veil of ignorance prevents
        them from knowing specifics about themselves or society that would allow them to bias those principles in their
        own favor, but they know general things about humanity. For example, they know everyone wants to pursue their
        own idea of the good, and to have more <i>primary goods</i> like rights and liberties, freedom of movement
        and choice of occupation, income and wealth, but they do not know their race, religion, wealth, nationality, or
        when they would enter into society. This is sort of like telling the person cutting a cake that they do not get
        to know who will get each slice. By depriving them of information they become unable unfairly give themselves or
        their friends excess cake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complete reasoning from the original position to the principles of justice above is quite long, so I will
        only outline it intuitively here. For the first principle, one can imagine that if they didn't know who they'd
        be in society, they'd want to protect themselves from becoming slaves or otherwise being disenfranchised, so
        they would want basic rights. They could only get everyone to agree to this if everyone gets the same set of
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second principle is designed to ensure that the least well off are not taken advantage of for the benefit of
        those who are already wealthy, but at the same time, give people who produce things that make everyone better
        off an incentive to do so. This addresses problems of both the communists and capitalists in that it prevents
        excessive wealth accumulation while still providing incentive for hard work. In the original position, we don't
        know if we'll be born with a lot of natural talent or little. So we don't want to risk a society that will give
        below average talent people terrible jobs just to make naturally talented people even better off, but if
        talented people being better off means less talented are better off too, then we're ok with that. It's still
        unclear where exactly to draw the line, but it gives us a principle to apply to more obvious cases like slavery
        or regressive tax schemes.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        This is a basic and oversimplified outline of how we can move from a conception of a fair society to some basic
        principles for that society. The rationale goes much deeper, and there are a lot of other interesting ideas
        Rawls has like those of <i>public reason</i> and <i>overlapping consensus</i>. If you are interested in more
        details of how these principles are derived or more of Rawls's ideas, I strongly recommend the

          1. Rawls's work extends that of prior philosophers including
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">John Locke</a> whose idea of the social contract is present
          in the preamble of the US Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
          are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these
          are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among
          Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed".
