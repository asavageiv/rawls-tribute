      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        John Rawls is my favorite political philosopher. He gave me tools to reason my way through the thicket of
        political ideas and a sense of which direction justice lies. I think his ideas should be common knowledge, and
        reasons for our political beliefs should be actively discussed. As such, for my tribute to Rawls, I present his
        principles of justice and an outline of their reasoning.
      </p>
      <h3>The Principles of Justice as Fairness</h3>

      <p>
        If you know nothing else from Rawls, know this. The principles of justice that would be chosen for a society
        that is "a fair system of cooperation between free and equal citizens from one generation to the next" are as
        follows:
        <ol id="principles">
          <li>
            <b>First Principle:</b> Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal
            basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Second Principle:</b> Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions:
            <ol id="sub-principles">
              <li>
                They are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of
                opportunity.
              </li>
              <li>
                They are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference
                principle).
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are prioritized such that the first principle is to be satisfied before the second, and fair
        equality of opportunity is to be satisfied before the difference principle. Furthermore, these principles only
        apply to the basic institutions of society. For example, they can be used to show that property-owning democracy
        and democratic socialism are
        compatible with the principles of justice, but laissez-faire capitalism, welfare-state capitalism, and socialist
        command economies are not. They they can not be used to compare two actual people, see that one is worse
        off and then say that means they deserve to get something from someone who is better off.
      </p>

        If you are interested in <i>why</i> these are the principles of justice, read on.

      <h3>Society as a Fair System of Cooperation</h3>
      <div class="quotebox">
        <div class="quote">"The correct regulative principle for anything depends on the nature of that thing."</div>
        <div class="citation"><i>A Theory of Justice</i></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Rawls attacks the problem of justice and society at its roots by starting with its basic structure. By basic
        structure we mean things like the laws laid down in the constitution and the economic system of society. If
        these things are unjust then we have no hope of a just society because all other activity takes place within the
        context of these structures. In order to determine whether some basic structure is just or not we must have
        principles to guide us, these will be the principles of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        To come up with reasonable principles, we have to be clear about what we're talking about. What do we mean by
        "society". Rawls defines society as, "a fair system of cooperation among its members from one generation to the
        next". This definition is why Rawls's conception of justice is called "justice as fairness". It has its roots in
        the ideas of social contracts, that the legitimacy of government derives from the consent of the
        governed<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, and the
        fact of reasonable plurality in society (that is, given enough people, differing experience will create
        reasonable diagreement). Note that society could be conceived
        of differently. For example, monarchies were often thought to derive their legitimacy from divine right. Rawls's
        definition is broader and more vague so it might bring more of us on board. It relies on the idea of fairness,
        which is widely considered important when dealing with questions of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This brings up the question of what we mean by "fair". Rawls answers this by changing the question to, “What
        terms of cooperation would free and equal citizens agree to under fair conditions?”. This makes the problem more
        tractable by allowing us to define fair conditions and then considering what would be agreed to under those
        conditions.
      </p>
      <h3>The Original Position and the Veil of Ignorance</h3>
      <div class="quotebox">
        <div class="quote">"In justice as fairness, men agree to share one another's fate."</div>
        <div class="citation"><i>A Theory of Justice</i></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        To have fair conditions, personal biases and historical biases must be removed, so Rawls asks us to imagine
        ourselves in an
        <i>original position</i> behind a <i>veil of ignorance</i>. In the original position a group of representatives
        must unanimously decide on the principles of justice for society. The veil of ignorance prevents them from
        knowing specifics about themselves or society that would allow them to bias those principles in their own favor,
        but they know general things about humanity. For example, they know everyone wants to pursue their own idea of
        the good, and to have more of <i>primary goods</i> like rights and liberties, freedom of movement and choice of
        occupation,
        income and wealth, but they do not know their race, religion, wealth, nationality, or when they would enter into
        society. This is sort of like telling the person cutting a cake that they will not get to decide who gets which
        slice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complete reasoning from the original position to the principles of justice above is quite long, so I will
        only outline it intuitively here. For the first principle, one can imagine that if they didn't know who they'd
        be in society,
        they'd want to protect themselves from becoming slaves or otherwise being disenfranchised, so they would want
        basic rights. They could only get everyone to agree to this if everyone gets the same set of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the
        second principle, one can imagine that they'd want to protect themselves from bad luck. If you're to be born
        poor, or slightly stupid, or in the wrong place without a lot of natural resources, you don't want your life to
        be shitty. But you don't want perfect equality either. If some inequality creates greater wealth for everyone,
        even the least well off, then it is still desirable. With this in mind one might
        agree to the second principle, which prevents gaining wealth at the expense of the least advantaged, but still
        encourages talent, hard work, and value production for society through some admissable inequality.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        This is just a basic outline from a conception of society to some basic principles and the logic can be taken
        much further. If you are interested in more details of how
        these principles are derived or more of Rawls's ideas, I strongly recommend the

        Reading that will probably be the smartest thing you do all year.

          1. Rawls's work extends that of prior philosophers including
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">John Locke</a> whose idea of the social contract is present
          in the preamble of the US Declaration
          of Independence: "We hold
          these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
          created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are
          Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among
          Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed".
