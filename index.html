      <p>John Bordley Rawls was a political philosopher.</p>
      <p>
        John Rawls is the greatest philosopher of the 20th century because he
        justified constitutional property owning democracy with reason
        created a theory of justice based on fairness
        he gave us principles of justice and the tools for deciding whether something is just or not
        he gives us a practical conception of a society that is free, equal, and stable.

        Think about this, for a second: How do you <em>know</em> that a system with equal rights for all is the best
        one? We in the US often take this for granted. Indeed, even our Declaration of Independence begins, "We hold
        these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
        certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

        How do we know whether the rights laid down in the Constitution are good or not? What principles can we judge
        them by? How can we reason about them in a way that is acceptable to the largest number of people?

        After all, there are hundreds of millions of people in the United States, of many different backgrounds,
        religions, and with different moral convinctions. They will reasonably disagree on a great many things. How can
        we justify our system of government to all of them?
        How can we decide between communism, lassaiz faire capitalism, property owning democracy, democratic socialism,
        and anarchy? How can we decide what rights are just or whether we should have equal rights for everyone?
